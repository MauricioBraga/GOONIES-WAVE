# Goonies WAVE patch

This repository contains a patch to the original Goonies game, released by Konami for [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) computers.  **Goonies** is a classic platform game developed and published by **Konami** for the **MSX** computer in 1986.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

The **patch** provided in this project is meant to be applied to the original Goonies ROM and it will add new music in WAVE format, replacing the original PSG music. 

In order to hear the new wave soundtrack, the patched game should be used with a [MSX Pico+ cartridge](https://www.msxpico.com/), made by Jeroen Taverne. It requires the firmware 2.05 or newer.

A new MSX palette, with better colors, is also added when running in a MSX2 computer.

Sound effects remain being played by PSG.  

After the initial release, a new option of music set is available. While the previous release included songs from BrainGames Goonies remake (Goonies 20th Anniversary Edition, released by BrainGames in 2006), this new set is a 100% BrainGames set, containing all the musics from the BrainGames Goonies remake, and used here with permission of the musician who did the songs, Jorrith Schaap. 

A comparative video showing the game with the original music and with the new music patch (with the release music set) can be seen here:
